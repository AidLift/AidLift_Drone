# Aid Lift Drone: Intelligent Fire Detection and Emergency Routing System

**Aid Lift Drone** is a research-driven prototype designed to explore how drones, artificial intelligence, and geospatial technologies can work together to improve emergency response during fire-related crises. While still in its development and testing phase, the project aims to demonstrate how automation can support first responders by providing them with faster detection capabilities and optimized route guidance.

## Project Overview

Wildfires and structural fires remain a growing challenge worldwide, threatening both human lives and ecosystems. Traditional fire detection systems often rely on manual reporting or satellite imaging, both of which can be slow and difficult to scale. Aid Lift Drone is built to tackle this challenge by leveraging computer vision and geospatial algorithms.

The project combines two core functionalities:

1. **Fire Detection from Images**  
   - Uses computer vision models to scan aerial or ground-level images.  
   - Identifies possible fire hazards, hotspots, or smoke signatures.  
   - Designed with adaptability in mind, so it can be integrated with drone-mounted cameras, CCTV networks, or satellite imagery in the future.
   - The term ‘fires’ here refers to images of smoky areas that suggest the possible presence of a fire in the region.

2. **Optimized Emergency Routing**  
   - Once a fire is detected, the system calculates the **closest and most effective route** for emergency response units (firefighters, medical aid, or evacuation support).  
   - The routing system accounts for speed, accessibility, and efficiency.
   - Potential integration with real-time traffic and terrain data is part of the roadmap.

## Current Status

- **Development Stage**: The system is still under experimental development and **has not yet been tested in real-world scenarios**.  
- **Prototype Goals**: Provide a proof-of-concept that shows how fire detection and routing can be combined into one platform.  
- **Limitations**: Current results are based on simulations and image-based testing, not live deployments.

## Vision

By automating parts of the detection and response workflow, Aid Lift Drone seeks to help emergency teams save more lives and reduce the damage caused by fires.

## Disclaimer

This project is an **academic and experimental prototype**. The system is not yet validated for operational use and should not be relied upon for real-world fire detection or routing. Always consult with official authorities and verified emergency services for actual response protocols.
